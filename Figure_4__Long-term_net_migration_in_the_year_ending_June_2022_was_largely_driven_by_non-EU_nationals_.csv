"Notes","1. We are developing estimates of international migration using new methods and data sources. As such, international migration statistics are badged as Experimental Statistics. The [Strengths and limitations section](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/longterminternationalmigrationprovisional/yearendingjune2022#strengths-and-limitations) includes more detail on how these estimates should be interpreted. 
2. YE: year ending. 
3. Non-EU figures are based on Home Office Border Systems data, EU figures are based on Registration and Population Interaction Database (RAPID) data received from Department for Work and Pensions and Home Revenue and Customs, and British Nationals figures are based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). See the [Measuring the data section](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/longterminternationalmigrationprovisional/yearendingjune2022#measuring-the-data) for more detail. 
4. Because of the experimental and provisional nature of these statistics, numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand."
